The code is in Git. The main repository is at::

    git@git.assembla.com:wagnejan_metrocar.git


Ask the :ref:`project-maintainer` to grant you access. In the meantime, you can
get the code via the Public clone URL::

    git://git.assembla.com/wagnejan_metrocar.git

    Are you new to Git? See: :doc:`/howto/git`


At the moment the installation process *severely flawed* and needs to be
revised. Documentation pending.

If you need to install the project before then, you can try searching the
legacy documentation:

* `<http://www.assembla.com/spaces/wagnejan_metrocar/wiki/SI2_-_Home>`_
* `<http://www.assembla.com/spaces/wagnejan_metrocar/documents>`_
* `<http://www.assembla.com/spaces/metrocar/wiki/Zprovozneni_Webservice_Ubuntu10_04_PostgreSQL8_4>`_

.. note:: *Word of advice*

    If it is at all possible for you, it is highly recommended to develop
    the project in a Unix-based OS, as that's what most of the devs use
    and you are likely to run into a lot less problems there.

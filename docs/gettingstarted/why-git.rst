A **distributed** version control system was chosen because it makes it much
easier to work on independent features concurrently in different
**branches**. While it's possible to use branches in SVN, the work involved
is much more difficult and error-prone.

Another benefit is great **speed**, because the whole repository is
available locally. Which also makes it possible to work off-line.

Git was chosen from the available DVCSs because it appears to have the
largest **user-base** at the moment, so it has the highest probability of
already being familiar to new coming contributors.

Prerequisites
=============

Before you start hacking on :doc:`Metrocar </overview/metrocar>`, you should
know some Django and Python. At the very least, you should have gone through
the `Django tutorial`_.

If you are new to Django you should start at `the Django documentation's
Getting started page`_. If you are also new to Python (or programming in
general, even), note the *see also* box which contains useful python resources.

Unlike many web frameworks, Django has a really good documentation. Apart from
the framework itself it also documents some *best practices* in web development
in general. So it's definitely a recommended read.

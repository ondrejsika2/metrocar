Project tasks automation / build system
=======================================

We are using `Paver`_ for this

    Paver is a Python-based software project scripting tool along the lines of Make or Rake. It is not designed to handle the dependency tracking requirements of, for example, a C program. It is designed to help out with all of your other repetitive tasks (run documentation generators, moving files around, downloading things), all with the convenience of Pythonâ€™s syntax and massive library of code.

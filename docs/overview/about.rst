About this documentation
========================

This is an attempt to finally create a proper documentation for this project.

We only have a chance of succeeding at this if all contributors follow
the :ref:`Contribution guidelines section on documentation
<contributing-documentation>`.


Sphinx
------
The documentation is made using the `Sphinx`_ documentation system, which has
become a standard way of writing documentation for Python projects. It is
written in the `reStructuredText`_ format and can then be rendered to HTML, PDF
or other formats.

To get familiar with it you can `read the docs
<http://sphinx.readthedocs.org/en/latest/index.html>`_ or a take a look
at the sources of some existing project's documentation, for example
`Django's <https://code.djangoproject.com/browser/django/trunk/docs>`_.

Why is it in English?
---------------------
Because that is the standard. Documentation to all Python projects is written
in English. Same as the docstrings, inline comments and the code itself.
And we are trying to make this project look like some *actual software
engineering*. If you are not fully comfortable with reading / writing technical English then **this is a great place to practice**. You are definitely going
to need these skills if you are ever planing to work on some *serious*
software projects.

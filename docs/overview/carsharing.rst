About carsharing
================

Carsharing is a model of car rental where people rent cars for short periods
of time, often by the hour. They are attractive to customers who make only
occasional use of a vehicle, as well as others who would like occasional
access to a vehicle of a different type than they use day-to-day. The
organization renting the cars may be a commercial business or the users may
be organized as a democratically controlled company, public agency,
cooperative, ad hoc grouping. Today there are more than one thousand cities
in the world where people can carshare.

Carsharing in the Czech Republic
================================

Carsharing isn't very widespread in the Czech Republic. (Not yet, anyway.)
There is one functioning carsharing organization that we know of -- a citizens'
association `Autonap≈Øl <http://www.autonapul.org/>`_ in Brno.
